I have done a summer internship with Professor Patrick Martin in his marine chemistry lab in 2021 involving the electrocatalysis of nitrates in seawater into nitrites. We used UV-vis techniques to determine the concentration of nitrite in the seawater. I have learnt a lot about troubleshooting issues in the lab from that. I am also proficient in Python and Javascript. From my coding skills I have also built a website for the NTU Aquatic Biochronology Lab. Also, you can have a look at my personal projects from my portfolio site at https://xchu002.github.io/portfolio/"]
